# Goals & Working Method

general: we should distinguish between should, shall, and must

## To be discussed
- Levels / Badges should be given to individuals as well as teams (in order to motivate them)
  - Thorsten and Stefan agree in general, but are these levels / badges only for a singular actitivey but also for multiple activities (multiple act. in different paths / at the same path)? Are the belts an example for levels/badges?
  - Stefan+Thorsten+Sven (S+T+S): it is not sufficient to know that the whole team has certain skills, but this is also necessarry for each singular team member, e.g., when defining a new team, when changing the team, when the criticality of the product increases 
  - Stefan: we can distinguish our meta model from BSIMM, SAMM, and DSOMM.

# Common
- Follow an experimental approach to develop the maturity model.
  - The model needs to be continuously improved --> S+T+S: we agree but too much changes may be harmful to the motivation
- feedback for activities needs to be an integral part
  - The model should use measurement whereever possible to "specify itself" (e.g., what is important for dev teams? what activity is most efficient?) --> Thorsten and Stefan: as a consequence, we need better tool support than just GitHub such that the teams can give feedback and if we want to measure a lot
  - Jez Humble said: Feedback should come from measuring, not from asking long questions. --> Stefan: Where does he say this? What are his reasons?
- Different learning paths or skill sets should be possible (graph)
  - Flexibility in choosing next activities based on the teams interests and needs
- It should be possible to make a lot of changes of the maturity model (fast).
  - Changes should be presented in a regular public review.
- Transparency and comparability
  - The model should allow an easy comparability team vs team that also helps managers and product owners (e.g., have some kind of levels, which could be reached on different paths)
  - The model should improve transparancy on the teams security skills.
  - The model should also help product owners and managers to understand the capability (activities are not only learned once but are applied regularly) of their team.
- The teams ***continuously*** work on improving themselves regarding software security.
  - The model should not define an end (the model is extendable) -> continuous improvement of capabilities
  - The model should focus on a continuous improvement of the team.
- The model should focuses on common DevOps teams (horses not unicorns)
  - there are better maturity models for classical projects and waterfall
  - we are not recreating classical ISO27001 activities
  - in case you do not do ops, just skip these branches
- We focus on the capability of the team and not the current security status of their products.
- The model should not overwhelm the teams (and thus scare them away), but instead motivate them to work on it
  - Providing guidance for the teams in choosing the next activity
- The model shouldn't ***force*** you to get external consulting or trainings. (no pay-to-win)
  - No additional trainer input should be necessary to understand and work with the model
  - Activities should be understandable and provide further readings if necessary
    - It should be hands-on-usable when talking about dev(sec)ops
  - Activities should not require a training in order to complete them.
  - Each activity should be understandable for the team as easy as possible, e.g., how it can be immplemented, what problems might be, what the expected benefits are
    - Stefan: the skill gap between teams is tremendous. Some (most?) teams need significant more basic knowledge than our current activity descriptions.
- The model should faciliatate sharing knowledge
  - teams that use our model can share their knowledge to external persons or teams
  - giving talks and writing articles
- Start with common technologies: web, mobile, cloud

# Later (we are not smart enough for that NOW)
- Providing guidance for team specific rough minimum target states that a team should be capable of
- It is not our goal that all teams have the same ultimate skillset at the end. The required skillset/competence level of a team depends on the criticality of its product. 
  - High competence does not necessarily mean that the team invests all security measure that they know but that they can choose the useful measures depending on the criticality of their product (i.e., security is still cost-efficient).
- Continue with more technologies and domains
  - C, SAP, and all other insecure technologies
  - In the future, we want to give specific recommendation for certain target groups or technologies , e.g., embedded, automotive, health, ...
  - The model should be able to cover different domains (e.g., mobile, embedded, automation, ...)

# Not
- The model should help the guild to improve itself. (see Agile literature)
  - The team needs a guild, a guild elder, a scrum master, or a security consultant that can consult the team.
- The main target group of the model are developer teams.
- Supporting teams that want to work agile (but may still be at the start/during the transformation process)
