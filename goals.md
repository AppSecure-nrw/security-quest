# Goals & Working Method

## Lars & Mark

- It should be possible to make a lot of changes (fast).
- The model should target DevOps Horses.
- The model should focus on continuous improvement.
- The model shouldn't force you to get external consulting or trainings.
- Follow an experimental approach to model development.
- Feedback should come from measuring, not from asking.
- Changes should be presented in a regular public review.

## Christian 
- The model should allow comparability (e. g.. have some kind of levels, which could be reached on different paths) 
- Different learning paths or skill sets should be possible 
- It should be hands-on-usable when talking about dev(sec)ops
- Levels / Badges should be given to individuals as well as teams
- The model should not define an end -> continous improvement
- The model should use measurement whereever possible to "specify itself" (e. g. what is important for dev teams? what activity is most efficient?) 

## Stefan, Niklas, Martin
- It is not our goal that all teams have the same ultimate skillset at the end. The required skillset/competence level of a team depends on the criticality of its product. 
  - High competence does not necessarily mean that the team invests all security measure that they know but that they can choose the useful measures depending on the criticality of their product (i.e., security is still cost-efficient).
- We focus on the capability of the team and not the current security status of their products. Though, they should be able to show on at least one product that they really have these capabilities.
- Our current focus is web, mobile, desktop.
  - In the future, we want to give specific recommendation for certain target groups, e.g., mobile, embedded, automotive, ...
- The main target group of the model are developers teams.
- The model should also help product owners and managers to understand the capability of their developers. 
- The model should help the guild to improve itself.
- The size of the model can easily become a huge issue with having 70 activities or more. Thus, a goal is that the model is still understandable and the devops teams do not get overwhelmed by it. Moreover, the model should be easy to grasp.
- The team that work on our model need supporting workshops and trainings for teams.
- The team needs a guild, a guild elder, a scrum master, or a security consultant that can consult the team.

- to be continued

## Sven
- Self-empowering teams to continuously work on improving themselves regarding security
- The model should not overwhelm the teams (and thus scare them away), but instead motivate them to work on it
- Flexibility in choosing next activities based on the teams interests
- Providing guidance for the teams in choosing the next activity
- Providing guidance for team specific rough minimum target states that a team should be capable of
- No additional trainer input should be necessary to understand and work with the model
- Supporting teams that want to work agile (but may still be at the start/during the transformation process)
- The model should be able to cover different domains (e.g., mobile, embedded, automation, ...)
- The model should improve transparancy on the teams security skills
- The model should fasciliatate sharing knowledge, i.e., incorporate the security guild (establishment, activities, etc.)
- Each activity should be understandable for the team as easy as possible, i.e., how it can be immplemented, what problems might be, what the expected benefits are
- The model needs to be continuously improved, feedback for activities needs to be an integral part
