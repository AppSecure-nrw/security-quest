# Goals & Working Method

## To be discussed
- Levels / Badges should be given to individuals as well as teams (in order to motivate them)

# Common
- Follow an experimental approach to model development.
  - The model needs to be continuously improved
- feedback for activities needs to be an integral part
  - The model should use measurement whereever possible to "specify itself" (e. g. what is important for dev teams? what activity is most efficient?) 
  - Jez said: Feedback should come from measuring, not from asking long questions.
- Different learning paths or skill sets should be possible (graph)
  - Flexibility in choosing next activities based on the teams interests
- It should be possible to make a lot of changes (fast).
  - Changes should be presented in a regular public review.
- Transparency and comparebility
  - The model should allow comparability team vs. team (e. g.. have some kind of levels, which could be reached on different paths) 
  - The model should improve transparancy on the teams security skills
  - The model should also help product owners and managers to understand the capability (not only learned...) of their team.
- ***continuously*** work on improving themselves regarding security
  - The model should not define an end (the model is extendable) -> continous improvement of capabilities
  - The model should focus on continuous improvement.
- The model should focuses on DevOps Horses: There are better Models for clasical Projects and Waterfall
  - we are not recreating classical ISO27001 activities
  - in case you do not do ops, just skip these branches
- We focus on the capability of the team and not the current security status of their products.
- The model should not overwhelm the teams (and thus scare them away), but instead motivate them to work on it
  - Providing guidance for the teams in choosing the next activity
- The model shouldn't ***force*** you to get external consulting or trainings. (no pay-to-win)
  - No additional trainer input should be necessary to understand and work with the model
  - Activities should be understandable and provide further readings if necessary
    - It should be hands-on-usable when talking about dev(sec)ops
  - Activities should not require a training in order to compleate it
  - Each activity should be understandable for the team as easy as possible, e.g., how it can be immplemented, what problems might be, what the expected benefits are
- The model should fasciliatate sharing knowledge
- Start with common technology: cloud, web, and mobile

# Later (we are not smart enough for that NOW)
- Providing guidance for team specific rough minimum target states that a team should be capable of
- It is not our goal that all teams have the same ultimate skillset at the end. The required skillset/competence level of a team depends on the criticality of its product. 
  - High competence does not necessarily mean that the team invests all security measure that they know but that they can choose the useful measures depending on the criticality of their product (i.e., security is still cost-efficient).
- C, SAP, and all other unsafe crap
  - In the future, we want to give specific recommendation for certain target groups or technologies , e.g., mobile, embedded, automotive, ...
- The model should be able to cover different domains (e.g., mobile, embedded, automation, ...)

# Not
- The team that work on our model need supporting workshops and trainings for teams.
  - see no pay-to-win
- The model should help the guild to improve itself. (see Agile literature)
  - The team needs a guild, a guild elder, a scrum master, or a security consultant that can consult the team.
- The main target group of the model are developers teams.
- Supporting teams that want to work agile (but may still be at the start/during the transformation process)
