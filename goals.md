# Goals & Working Method

## Lars & Mark

- It should be possible to make a lot of changes (fast).
- The model should target DevOps Horses.
- The model should focus on continuous improvement.
- The model shouldn't force you to get external consulting or trainings.
- Follow an experimental approach to model development.
- Feedback should come from measuring, not from asking.
- Changes should be presented in a regular public review.

## Christian 
- The model should allow comparability (e. g.. have some kind of levels, which could be reached on different paths) 
- Different learning paths or skill sets should be possible 
- It should be hands-on-usable when talking about dev(sec)ops
- Levels / Badges should be given to individuals as well as teams
- The model should not define an end -> continous improvement
- The model should use measurement whereever possible to "specify itself" (e. g. what is important for dev teams? what activity is most efficient?)
